**Type casting** and **type conversion** are two concepts in programming that involve changing a variable from one data type to another. While they are often used interchangeably, they can have slightly different meanings depending on the context. Here's a breakdown of both:

### 1. Type Casting
Type casting refers to explicitly converting a variable from one type to another. In Java, this can be done using casting operators. Itâ€™s commonly used for both primitive types and reference types.

#### **Types of Casting**:
- **Widening Casting** (Implicit Casting): This is automatically done by the compiler when converting a smaller primitive type to a larger primitive type. For example, converting an `int` to a `long` or a `float`.

  ```java
  int num = 10;
  long bigNum = num; // Implicit casting (widening)
  ```

- **Narrowing Casting** (Explicit Casting): This requires explicit casting by the programmer, as it involves converting a larger primitive type to a smaller primitive type. For example, converting a `double` to an `int`.

  ```java
  double decimalNum = 10.5;
  int wholeNum = (int) decimalNum; // Explicit casting (narrowing)
  ```

#### **Example of Type Casting**:
```java
public class TypeCastingExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Widening Casting
        int intNum = 100;
        long longNum = intNum; // Implicit casting
        System.out.println("Widening Casting: " + longNum);

        // Narrowing Casting
        double doubleNum = 9.78;
        int castedNum = (int) doubleNum; // Explicit casting
        System.out.println("Narrowing Casting: " + castedNum);
    }
}
```

### 2. Type Conversion
Type conversion is a more general term that refers to the process of converting a variable from one data type to another, either implicitly or explicitly. It can apply to both primitive types and reference types, including objects.

#### **Types of Conversion**:
- **Primitive Type Conversion**: Similar to type casting, where you convert between primitive types.
- **Object Type Conversion**: This can include converting from one class type to another in an inheritance hierarchy (e.g., upcasting and downcasting).

#### **Example of Type Conversion**:
- **Upcasting** (Automatic Conversion):
  ```java
  class Animal {}
  class Dog extends Animal {}

  Animal animal = new Dog(); // Upcasting (automatic)
  ```

- **Downcasting** (Explicit Conversion):
  ```java
  Animal animal = new Dog(); // Upcasting
  Dog dog = (Dog) animal; // Downcasting (explicit)
  ```

### Summary
- **Type Casting**: Explicitly converting a variable from one type to another, typically involving primitive types. It can be narrowing (requires explicit casting) or widening (automatic).
- **Type Conversion**: A broader term that includes type casting but also covers conversions between object types in an inheritance hierarchy and implicit conversions.

### Key Differences
- **Type Casting** usually refers specifically to primitive data types and is about changing one type to another with a cast operator.
- **Type Conversion** encompasses a wider range of type changes, including both primitive and reference types, and can occur implicitly or explicitly.
